        <p>Thank you for participating in this study. </p>

        <p>We are interested in how people make simple judgments about common words.
        Please position this window in the center of your screen so you can comfortably view the words.</p>

        <p>You will see a list of words appear one at a time and make a judgment about each one
        (more details on the next page). After each word, you will do a few math problems.
        </p>
