        <p>We are trying to find a set of words that are neither too easy nor too hard for people to process.
            We want to use these words in an upcoming study of brain activity during word processing.
            Your responses today will help us select appropriate words.</p>

        <p>You will be asked to make a judgment about each word in the list.
            Specifically, you will decide how relevant each word is to an imaginary scenario.</p>

        <p>We would like you to imagine that you are planning to move to a new home in a foreign land.
            Over the next few months, you’ll need to purchase a new house and find help transporting your belongings.

        <p>For each word you see, think of how relevant the word would be for you in this moving situation.
        Some of the words may be relevant and others may not – it’s up to you to decide.</p>


        <p>You will see each word for only a few seconds.
            Therefore, for some words, you will find it easy to judge its relevance.
            For other words, you will find it difficult. For each word, you will try to judge its relevance
            and decide if it is easy or difficult.</p>

        <p>There are two possible choices for each word: "Yes" and "No".
            You will respond by pressing the "y" key for "Yes" or the "n" key for "No".</p>

        <p>For example, if we asked you to judge the word "owner",
            you would press "y" if you can easily judge its relevance, and "n" if you find it difficult.</p>

        <p>The task will automatically advance to the next word after a fixed amount of time.
            There will be a brief screen showing a cross, "+", between each word presentation.</p>

        <p>To ensure participants are thinking carefully about each word, we will
          randomly pause the task and ask you to type a description of how you made your judgment.</p>
