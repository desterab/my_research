        <p>We are trying to find a set of words that are neither too easy nor too hard for people to process.
            We want to use these words in an upcoming study of brain activity during word processing.
            Your responses today will help us select appropriate words.</p>

        <p>You will be asked to make a judgment about each word in the list.
            Specifically, you will decide whether or not you can easily
            generate a ``mental movie'' related to that word.</p>

        <p>When you read a word, it can trigger many different thoughts.
            For example, if you see the word ``BASEBALL'' you might have a mental image of a baseball,
            you might hear the crack of a bat hitting a ball, you might think of related concepts like ballpark,
            players, and fans. You might have a mental image of a baseball game that includes the sounds,
            sights, and smells of a baseball stadium. You might think back to personal experiences
            related to baseball such as the last time you watched a game, or learning to play baseball as a child.
            All of these thoughts may be associated with positive or negative emotions.</p>

        <p>For each word you see, allow it to activate as many different thoughts as possible.
            Then use these thoughts to generate a mental movie (like a detailed image of spending
            an afternoon at a baseball game or what it is like to be a player on a baseball field).</p>

        <p>You will see each word for only a few seconds. Therefore, for some words, you will find it easy to
            generate a mental movie. For other words, you will find it difficult.
            For each word, you will try to form a mental movie and decide if it is easy or difficult. </p>

        <p>There are two possible choices for each word: "Yes" and "No". You will respond by pressing
            the "y" key for "Yes" or the "n" key for "No".</p>

        <p>For example, if we asked you to judge the word "owner", you would press "y" if you can
            easily generate a scene, and "n" if you find it difficult.</p>

        <p>The task will automatically advance to the next word after a fixed amount of time.
            There will be a brief screen showing a cross, "+", between each word presentation.</p>

        <p>To ensure participants are thinking carefully about each word, we will randomly pause
            the task and ask you to type a description of your mental movie.</p>
