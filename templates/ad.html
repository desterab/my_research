<!-- 
	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.  

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints

							    <h1>Call for participants</h1>
							    	<p>The Cognitive Variability Laboratory at Michigan State University is looking for participants in
a research study of cognitive processing.</p>

	<p>During this study you will view, words, letters, pictures, or digits on a computer screen.
You may be asked to make simple judgments about these items (e.g., “would this item fit in a shoebox?”).</p>

<p>You will also complete some reasoning tasks that involve solving problems. These problems involve patterns composed
of words, numbers, or pictures. You will try to determine which item completes the pattern, what rule the pattern
follows, or what items break the rule.</p>

<p>Before each task you will receive detailed instructions and be given a chance to practice.
The tasks are designed to be moderately difficult; it is normal to find the tasks challenging.</p>

<p><b>Because some of the material involves English words, you must be a native English speaker to participate in this research.</b></p>

<p><b>You must be at least 18 years old to participate in this research.</b></p>
							    <div class="alert alert-danger">
									<strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong> 
									If you have already completed this task before the system will not 
									allow you to run again. If this looks familiar please return the 
									HIT so someone else can participate.
							    </div>
							    <p>
								    Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site 
								    above to begin the task.
								</p>

									You should thus show them instructions to begin the 
									experiment ... usually a button to launch a new browser
									window pointed at your server.

									It is important you do not change the code for the
									openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
									to work.
